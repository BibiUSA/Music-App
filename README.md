This is a music sharing social media application that allows users to share a youtube video of the song they like, choose the starting point and end point of the video share, and post it for others to see.

The viewers can navigate through videos on their feed, and interact with the posts by liking it, directly messaging the post owner if you're connected with the owner, or sharing the post with others in their connections. Viewers can also use instant messaging to message between their friends.

To add friends, users can click on a profile or search for profiles in the search bar in the navigation bar. Whenever someone likes your post, sends you a friend request or accepts your friend request, or even messages you directly, you will be notified in the navigation menu.

The tech stack used to build this project includes React JS, regular CSS, and bootstrap for the frontend along with authentication handled by Firebase.
The backend utilizes postgreSQL for most of the post data and utlizes noSQL for keeping track of friendships and messaging. The messaging also utilizes websockets to have instant messaging.
